                    <p>The week includes dynamic services designed specifically for teenagers, with contemporary worship, fun games, stacks of activities and sports, focused small-groups and moments for young people to treasure.

                        MOVE is CIY's summer residential event intentionally designed for 14-18 year olds... but it's more than just an event. It's an all-inclusive experience that not only provides food, lodging, sports, fun activities, and an age-intentional program, it also aims to provide encounters with Jesus that leads young people to embrace Him and the Kingdom Work purposes they've been called to.
