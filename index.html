                <p>
                    YFC (Youth For Christ) Sligo is an organisation apart of YFC International - a worldwide organisation
                    dedicated to sharing the good news that Jesus christ has come to seek and save the lost. <br> <br>

                    YFC Sligo is a small group that meets each month to share in worship and praise, the groups also travel
                    to different events around Ireland to make an impact on the youth of today.
